## Loading and preprocessing the data

```r
raw_data<-read.csv('activity.csv')
summary(raw_data)
```

```
##      steps                date          interval     
##  Min.   :  0.00   2012-10-01:  288   Min.   :   0.0

##  NA's   :2304     (Other)   :15840
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
ignore the missing data

```r
complete_data<-na.omit(raw_data)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
